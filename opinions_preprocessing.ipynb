Comp. Laws Utah 1876, p. 585. The same Code further provides that 'every person guilty of murder in the first degree shall suffer death, or, upon the recommendation of the jury, may be imprisoned at hard labor in the penitentiary for life, at the discretion of the court, and every person guilty of murder in the second degree shall be imprisoned at hard labor and the penitentiary for not less than five nor more than fifteen years.' Comp. Laws Utah 1876, p. 586. It is clear that the authority given in the section last quoted, to substitute imprisonment at hard labor in the penitentiary for life for the penalty of death, when the accused is found guilty of murder in the first degree, depends upon a previous recommendation to that effect by the jury. Without such recommendation, the court, in the absence of sufficient grounds for a new trial, has no alternative but to sentence the accused to suffer death. While in this case the jury were instructed as to what constituted murder in the first and second degrees, they were not informed as to their right, under the statute, to recommend imprisonment for life at hard labor in the penitentiary in place of the punishment of death. If their attention had been called to that statute, it may be that they would have made such a recommendation, and thereby enabled the court to reduce the punishment to imprisonment for life. We are of opinion that the court erred in not directing the attention of the jury to this matter. The statute evidently proceeds upon the ground that there may be cases of murder in the first degree, the punishment for which by imprisonment for life at hard labor will suffice to meet the ends of public justice. Its object could only have been met through a recommendation by the jury that the lesser punishment be inflicted, and it is not to be presumed that they were aware of their right to make such recommendation. The failure of the court to instruct them upon this point prevented it from imposing the punishment of imprisonment for life, even if, in its judgment, the circumstances of the case rendered such a course proper. It was well said in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice HENDERSON, in the supreme court of the territory, that by the action of the district court 'the prisoner was deprived of a substantial right. The determination of the question as to whether he should suffer death or imprisonment was one of vital consequence to him. The jury, to whom the statute commits the determination of that question, at least in part, were not informed of their duty and responsibility in the matter, so as to require them to exercise their judgment and discretion in relation to it, and, by the verdict they rendered, the court had none.' These views are in accordance with the fundamental rules obtaining in the trial of criminal cases involving life.</p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other questions were discussed at the bar, but as the instructions relating to them are somewhat obscure, and as they may not arise upon another trial in the form in which they are now presented, we forbear a determination of them.</p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the error indicated the judgment is reversed, with directions for a new trial, and for such further proceedings as may not be inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\\n        <p> Reversing 16 Pac.

F. Sapp, contra</i>.</p>\\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\\n      <p class=\"indent\">When this cause was reached in its order upon the docket, there being no appearance by the appellant, the appellee had him called and the appeal dismissed under Rule 16. Our rules require that, 'upon the filing of the transcript of a record brought up by writ of error or appeal, the appearance of counsel for the plaintiff in error or appellant shall be entered.' Rule 9, par. 3. This rule was adopted for the purpose of making some attorney of the court responsible for the due prosecution of the suit, and it was intended for something more than mere form. Parties should understand that they are represented here by their counsel, and that notice to counsel is ordinarily equivalent to notice to themselves.</p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\\n      <p class=\"indent\">This cause was docketed here nearly two years and a half before it was called. The attorney of record seems to have done all he was expected to do. But the appellant himself was so unmindful of his interests, that he did not know the counsel, upon whom he relied for the presentation of his case, had died before the commencement of the present term, and had been unable to attend to business on account of impaired health for a long time before his death. In the crowded state of our docket, filled with cases from all parts of the United States, it is our duty to take special care that the necessary delays in disposing of the business are not added to by the neglect of counsel or parties. For this reason, our rules requiring causes to be ready for hearing when reached are, and will continue to be, rigidly enforced.</p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Motion denied</i>.</p>\\n    </div>\\n    \n",

Mitchell</i> for plaintiff in error.</p>\\n<p><i>Mr. Assistant Attorney General Maury</i> for defendant in error.</p>\\n<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\\n<p>The plaintiff in error, Calton, was indicted in the District Court of the Second Judicial District of the Territory of Utah for the crime of murder in the first degree, in that he \"feloniously, unlawfully, wilfully, purposely, premeditatedly, deliberately, and of his malice aforethought,\" killed and murdered one Michael Cullen. Under the plea of not guilty evidence was introduced by him for the purpose of showing: first, that at the time of the killing he was incapable, by reason of unsoundness of mind, of committing any criminal offence; second, that at most the killing was \"upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion,\" and, therefore, he could not be found guilty of any higher offence than voluntary manslaughter; third, that at the time of the killing he had reasonable ground to apprehend, and did apprehend, that the deceased was about to do him great bodily harm.</p>\\n<p>He was found guilty of murder in the first degree. A motion for a new trial having been denied, and the defendant having elected, as under the territorial statutes he might do, to suffer death by shooting, rather than by hanging, it was adjudged that on a named day, between certain hours, he be publicly shot. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the Territory that judgment was affirmed, \"save as to the time and the publicity of the execution thereof.\" This saving was because the local statute provides that \"a judgment of death must be executed within the walls or yard of a jail or some convenient private place in the district.\" Laws of Utah, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> 1878, p. 136. The present writ of error brings up for review that judgment of affirmance.</p>\\n<p>It appeared in proof that Calton, Tiberty and Cullen were residents of the Star Mining District in the Territory, and well acquainted with each other. On the morning the shooting occurred, Calton and Tiberty went to Milford, a small town near by, and there happened to meet Cullen. During the day they all indulged in strong drink, and became somewhat intoxicated. They were together during most of the time, and apparently upon friendly terms. About six o'clock in the afternoon the three started for home. They left Milford together in a wagon, Calton and Cullen sitting on the driver's seat, Calton driving, and Tiberty on a pile of ore sacks in the body of the wagon. They did not get far in the direction of their homes when Tiberty, leaving his bottle of liquor on the sacks, alighted from the wagon to get a whiplash that Calton had dropped. While he was on the ground a dispute, in some way not fully explained, arose between Cullen and Calton about the possession of Tiberty's bottle of liquor. Subsequently, and while the latter was off the wagon, a struggle ensued between Cullen and Calton, during which they clinched, each one having hold of the other's throat in such manner as to satisfy Tiberty, who was a short distance away, that they were angry. At one time Cullen seemed to be pressing Calton against or over the dash-board. The latter finally released himself from the grasp of his antagonist, who was much the stouter man, and, jumping to the ground, took a loaded pistol from a bundle he had in the wagon, and fired at Cullen five shots in rapid succession. According to the statements of Tiberty the deceased did not move after the first shot, the defendant saying, immediately after that shot was fired, that he had killed him, and that he \"might as well give him the rest.\" Calton and Tiberty returned to Milford with the dead body in the wagon, and the former surrendered himself to an officer of the law.</p>\\n<p>The penal code of Utah established by the act of February 18, 1876, provides that \"every murder perpetrated by poison, lying in wait, or any other kind of wilful, deliberate, malicious <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> and premeditated killing; or committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, rape, burglary, or robbery; or perpetrated from a premeditated design, unlawfully and maliciously to effect the death of any other human being other than him who is killed; or perpetrated by any act greatly dangerous to the lives of others, and evidencing a depraved mind, regardless of human life, is murder in the first degree; and any other homicide committed under such circumstances as would have constituted murder at common law, is murder in the second degree.\" Compiled Laws Utah, 1876, p. 585.</p>\\n<p>The same code further provides that: \"Every person guilty of murder in the first degree shall suffer death, or, upon the recommendation of the jury, may be imprisoned at hard labor in the penitentiary for life, at the discretion of the court, and every person guilty of murder in the second degree, shall be imprisoned at hard labor in the penitentiary for not less than five, nor more than fifteen years.\" Compiled Laws Utah, 1876, p. 586.</p>\\n<p>It is clear that the authority given in the section last quoted, to substitute imprisonment at hard labor in the penitentiary for life for the penalty of death, when the accused is found guilty of murder in the first degree, depends upon a previous recommendation to that effect by the jury. Without such recommendation the court, in the absence of sufficient grounds for a new trial, has no alternative but to sentence the accused to suffer death. While in this case the jury were instructed as to what constituted murder in the first and second degrees, they were not informed as to their right, under the statute, to recommend imprisonment for life at hard labor in the penitentiary in place of the punishment of death. If their attention had been called to that statute, it may be that they would have made such a recommendation, and thereby enabled the court to reduce the punishment to imprisonment for life. We are of opinion that the court erred in not directing the attention of the jury to this matter. The statute evidently proceeds upon the ground that there may be cases of murder in the first degree, the punishment for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> which by imprisonment for life at hard labor will suffice to meet the ends of public justice. Its object could only have been met through a recommendation by the jury that the lesser punishment be inflicted, and it is not to be presumed that they were aware of their right to make such recommendation. The failure of the court to instruct them upon this point prevented it from imposing the punishment of imprisonment for life, even if, in its judgment, the circumstances of the case rendered such a course proper. It was well said in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Henderson, in the Supreme Court of the Territory, that by the action of the District Court \"the prisoner was deprived of a substantial right. The determination of the question as to whether he should suffer death or imprisonment was one of vital consequence to him. The jury to whom the statute commits the determination of that question, at least in part, were not informed of their duty and responsibility in the matter so as to require them to exercise their judgment and discretion in relation to it, and by the verdict they rendered the court had none.\" These views are in accordance with the fundamental rules obtaining in the trial of criminal cases involving life.</p>\\n<p>Other questions were discussed at the bar, but as the instructions relating to them are somewhat obscure, and as they may not arise upon another trial in the form in which they are now presented, we forbear a determination of them.</p>\\n<p><i>For the error indicated the judgment is reversed, with directions for a new trial, and for such further proceedings as may not be inconsistent with this opinion.</i></p>\\n</div>\n",

Freeman.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>\\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\\n<p>This case concerns the citizenship, for purposes of federal-court diversity jurisdiction, of national banks, <i>i. e.,</i> corporate entities chartered not by any State, but by the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Treasury. Congress empowered federal district courts to adjudicate civil actions between \"citizens of different States\" where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1). A business organized as a corporation, for diversity jurisdiction purposes, is \"deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated\" and, since 1958, also \"of the State where it has its principal place of business.\" § 1332(c)(1). State banks, usually chartered as corporate bodies by a particular State, ordinarily fit comfortably within this prescription. Federally chartered national banks do not, for they are not incorporated by \"any State.\" For diversity jurisdiction purposes, therefore, Congress has discretely provided that national banks \"shall . . . be deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\" § 1348.</p>\\n<p>The question presented turns on the meaning, in § 1348's context, of the word \"located.\" Does it signal, as the petitioning national bank and the United States, as <i>amicus curiae,</i> urge, that the bank's citizenship is determined by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*307</span> place designated in the bank's articles of association as the location of its main office? Or does it mean, in addition, as respondents urge and the Court of Appeals held, that a national bank is a citizen of every State in which it maintains a branch?</p>\\n<p>Recognizing that \"located\" is not a word of \"enduring rigidity,\" <i>Citizens &amp; Southern Nat. Bank</i> v. <i>Bougas,</i> 434 U.S. 35, 44 (1977), but one that gains its precise meaning from context, we hold that a national bank, for § 1348 purposes, is a citizen of the State in which its main office, as set forth in its articles of association, is located. Were we to hold, as the Court of Appeals did, that a national bank is additionally a citizen of every State in which it has established a branch, the access of a federally chartered bank to a federal forum would be drastically curtailed in comparison to the access afforded state banks and other state-incorporated entities. Congress, we are satisfied, created no such anomaly.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>I</h2>\\n<p>Petitioner Wachovia Bank, National Association (Wachovia), is a national banking association with its designated main office in Charlotte, North Carolina.<sup>[1]</sup> Wachovia operates branch offices in many States, including South Carolina.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*308</span> The litigation before us commenced when plaintiff-respondent Daniel G. Schmidt III and others, citizens of South Carolina, sued Wachovia in a South Carolina state court for fraudulently inducing them to participate in an illegitimate tax shelter. Shortly thereafter, Wachovia filed a petition in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, seeking to compel arbitration of the dispute. As the sole basis for federal-court jurisdiction, Wachovia alleged the parties' diverse citizenship. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332. The District Court denied Wachovia's petition on the merits; neither the parties nor the court questioned the existence of federal subject-matter jurisdiction. On appeal, a divided Fourth Circuit panel determined that the District Court lacked diversity jurisdiction over the action; it therefore vacated the judgment and instructed the District Court to dismiss the case.</p>\\n<p>The Court of Appeals' majority observed that Wachovia's citizenship for diversity purposes is controlled by § 1348, which provides that \"national banking associations\" are \"deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\" As the panel majority read § 1348, Wachovia is \"located\" in, and is therefore a \"citizen\" of, every State in which it maintains a branch office. Thus Wachovia's branch operations in South Carolina, in the majority's view, rendered the bank a citizen of South Carolina. Given the South <span class=\"star-pagination\">*309</span> Carolina citizenship of the opposing parties, the majority concluded that the matter could not be adjudicated in federal court. 388 F.3d 414, 432 (CA4 2004).</p>\\n<p>Circuit Judge King dissented. He read § 1348 and its statutory precursors to provide national banks with \"the same access to federal courts as that accorded other banks and corporations.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 434. On his reading, Wachovia is a citizen only of North Carolina, the State in which its main office is located, not of every State in which it maintains a branch office; accordingly, he concluded, Wachovia's petition qualified for federal-court adjudication.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\\n<p>We granted certiorari to resolve the disagreement among Courts of Appeals on the meaning of § 1348. 545 U.S. 1113 (2005). Compare <i>Horton</i> v. <i>Bank One, N. A.,</i> 387 F.3d 426, 429, 431 (CA5 2004) (for § 1348 purposes, \"a national bank is not `located' in, and thus [is] not a citizen of, every state in which it has a branch\"; rather, the provision retains \"jurisdictional parity for national banks vis-à-vis state banks and corporations\"), and <i>Firstar Bank, N. A.</i> v. <i>Faul,</i> 253 F.3d 982, 993-994 (CA7 2001) (same), with 388 F.3d, at 432 (§ 1348 renders national bank a citizen, not only of the State in which its main office is located, but also of every State in which it has branch operations), and <i>World Trade Center Properties, LLC</i> v. <i>Hartford Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 345 F.3d 154, 161 (CA2 2003) (dictum) (same).</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>II</h2>\\n<p>When Congress first authorized national banks in 1863, it specified that any \"suits, actions, and proceedings by and against [them could] be had\" in federal court. See Act of Feb. 25, 1863, § 59, 12 Stat. 681. National banks thus could \"sue and be sued in the federal district and circuit courts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*310</span> solely because they were national banks, without regard to diversity, amount in controversy or the existence of a federal question in the usual sense.\" <i>Mercantile Nat. Bank at Dallas</i> v. <i>Langdeau,</i> 371 U.S. 555, 565-566 (1963). State banks, however, like other state-incorporated entities, could initiate actions in federal court only on the basis of diversity of citizenship or the existence of a federal question. See <i>Petri</i> v. <i>Commercial Nat. Bank of Chicago,</i> 142 U.S. 644, 648-649 (1892).</p>\\n<p>Congress ended national banks' automatic qualification for federal jurisdiction in 1882. An enactment that year provided in relevant part:</p>\\n<blockquote>\"[T]he jurisdiction for suits hereafter brought by or against any association established under any law providing for national-banking associations . . . shall be the same as, and not other than, the jurisdiction for suits by or against banks not organized under any law of the United States which do or might do banking business where such national-banking associations may be doing business when such suits may be begun[.]\" Act of July 12, 1882, § 4, 22 Stat. 163.</blockquote>\\n<p>Under this measure, national banks could no longer invoke federal-court jurisdiction solely \"on the ground of their Federal origin,\" <i>Petri,</i> 142 U.S., at 649; instead, for federal jurisdictional purposes, Congress placed national banks \"on the same footing as the banks of the state where they were located,\" <i>Leather Manufacturers' Bank</i> v. <i>Cooper,</i> 120 U.S. 778, 780 (1887).</p>\\n<p>In 1887 revisions to prescriptions on federal jurisdiction, Congress replaced the 1882 provision on jurisdiction over national banks and first used the \"located\" language today contained in § 1348. The 1887 provision stated in relevant part:</p>\\n<blockquote>\"[A]ll national banking associations established under the laws of the United States shall, for the purposes of all actions by or against them, real, personal or mixed, and all suits in equity, <i>be deemed citizens of the States</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*311</span> <i>in which they are respectively located;</i> and in such cases the circuit and district courts shall not have jurisdiction other than such as they would have in cases between individual citizens of the same State.\" Act of Mar. 3, 1887, § 4, 24 Stat. 554-555 (emphasis added).<sup>[4]</sup></blockquote>\\n<p>Like its 1882 predecessor, the 1887 Act \"sought to limit . . . the access of national banks to, and their suability in, the federal courts to the same extent to which non-national banks [were] so limited.\" <i>Langdeau,</i> 371 U.S., at 565-566.</p>\\n<p>In the Judicial Code of 1911,<sup>[5]</sup> Congress combined two formerly discrete provisions on proceedings involving national banks, but retained without alteration the clause deeming national banks to be \"citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\" Act of Mar. 3, 1911, § 24 (Sixteenth), 36 Stat. 1091-1093.<sup>[6]</sup> Finally, as part of the 1948 Judicial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*312</span> Code revision, Congress enacted § 1348 in its current form. Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 933. The provision now reads:</p>\\n<blockquote>\"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action commenced by the United States, or by direction of any officer thereof, against any national banking association, any civil action to wind up the affairs of any such association, and any action by a banking association established in the district for which the court is held, under chapter 2 of Title 12, to enjoin the Comptroller of the Currency, or any receiver acting under his direction, as provided by such chapter.</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\"All national banking associations shall, for the purposes of all other actions by or against them, be deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1348.</blockquote>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>III</h2>\\n<p>The Fourth Circuit panel majority advanced three principal reasons for deciding that Wachovia is \"located\" in, and therefore a \"citizen\" of, every State in which it maintains a branch office. First, consulting dictionaries, the Court of Appeals observed that \"[i]n ordinary parlance\" the term \"located\" refers to \"physical presence in a place.\" 388 F.3d, at 416-417 (internal quotation marks omitted). Banks have a physical presence, the Fourth Circuit stated, wherever they operate branches. <i>Id.,</i> at 417. Next, the court noted, \"Section 1348 uses two distinct terms to refer to the presence of a banking association: `established' and `located.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 419. \"To give independent meaning\" to each word, the court said, \"it is most reasonable to understand the place where a national bank is `established' to refer to a bank's charter location, and to understand the place where it is `located' to refer to the place or places where it has a physical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*313</span> presence.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Finally, the Court of Appeals stressed that in <i>Citizens &amp; Southern Nat. Bank</i> v. <i>Bougas,</i> 434 U.S. 35 (1977), this Court interpreted the term \"located\" in the former venue statute for national banks, see 12 U.S.C. § 94 (1976 ed.), as encompassing any county in which a bank maintains a branch office. 388 F.3d, at 419-420. Reasoning that \"the jurisdiction and venue statutes pertain to the same subject matter, namely the amenability of national banking associations to suit in federal court,\" the panel majority concluded that, \"under the <i>in pari materia</i> canon[,] the two statutes should be interpreted\" consistently. <i>Id.,</i> at 422.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\n<p>None of the Court of Appeals' rationales persuade us to read § 1348 to attribute to a national bank, for diversity jurisdiction purposes, the citizenship of each State in which the bank has established branch operations. First, the term \"located,\" as it appears in the National Bank Act, has no fixed, plain meaning. In some provisions, the word unquestionably refers to a single place: the site of the banking association's designated main office. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 12 U.S.C. § 52 (national bank's capital stock certificates must state \"the name and location of the association\"); § 55 (requiring notice of sale of capital stock \"in a newspaper of the city or town in which the bank is located\"); § 75 (bank's regular annual shareholders' meeting shall be rescheduled when it \"falls on a legal holiday in the State in which the bank is located\"); § 182 (requiring publication of a notice of dissolution \"in the city or town in which the association is located\"). In other provisions, \"located\" apparently refers to or includes branch offices. See, <i>e. g.,</i> § 36(j) (defining \"branch\" to include \"any branch place of business located in any State\"); § 85 (limiting interest rate charged by national bank to \"rate allowed by the laws of the State, Territory, or District where the bank is located\") (construed in OCC Interpretive Letter No. 822 (Feb. 17, 1998), [1997-1998 Transfer Binder] CCH Fed. Banking <span class=\"star-pagination\">*314</span> L. Rep. ¶ 81-265, pp. 90, 256-90, 257); 12 U.S.C. § 92 (permitting national bank to act as insurance agent in certain circumstances when bank is \"located and doing business in any place the population of which does not exceed five thousand inhabitants\") (construed in 12 CFR § 7.1001 (2005)).<sup>[7]</sup> Recognizing the controlling significance of context, we stated in <i>Bougas,</i> regarding a venue provision for national banks: \"There is no enduring rigidity about the word `located.'\" 434 U.S., at 44.</p>\\n<p>Second, Congress may well have comprehended the words \"located\" and \"established,\" as used in § 1348, not as contrasting, but as synonymous or alternative terms. When Congress enacted § 1348's statutory predecessors and then § 1348 itself, a national bank was almost always \"located\" only in the State in which it was \"established,\" under any of the proffered definitions of the two words, for, with rare exceptions, a national bank could not operate a branch outside its home State. Not until 1994 did Congress provide broad authorization for national banks to establish branches across state lines. See <i>supra,</i> at 307-308, n. 2. Congress' use of the two terms may be best explained as a coincidence of statutory codification. Deriving from separate provisions enacted in different years, the word \"established\" appearing in the first paragraph of § 1348 and the word \"located\" appearing in the second paragraph were placed in the same section in the 1911 revision of the Judicial Code. See <i>supra,</i> at 311-312, n. 6. The codifying Act explicitly stated that \"so far as [its provisions were] substantially the same as existing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*315</span> statutes,\" they should \"be construed as continuations thereof, and not as new enactments.\" Act of Mar. 3, 1911, § 294, 36 Stat. 1167; see <i>Federal Intermediate Credit Bank of Columbia</i> v. <i>Mitchell,</i> 277 U.S. 213, 216 (1928) (1911 Act \"was in substance a reenactment of the earlier provisions in respect of . . . jurisdiction\"). In this light, it is unsurprising that, in 1947, this Court, referring to a national bank's citizenship under the 1911 Act, used the terms \"located\" and \"established\" as alternatives. See <i>Cope</i> v. <i>Anderson,</i> 331 U.S. 461, 467 (\"For jurisdictional purposes, a national bank is a `citizen' of the state in which it is established or located[.]\").<sup>[8]</sup></p>\\n<p>Finally, <i>Bougas</i> does not control the meaning of § 1348. In that case, we construed a now-repealed venue provision, which stated that actions against national banking associations could be filed \"in any State, county, or municipal court in the county or city in which said association [was] located.\" 434 U.S., at 35-36 (quoting 12 U.S.C. § 94 (1976 ed.)). We held that, for purposes of this provision, a national bank was located, and venue was therefore proper, in any county or city where the bank maintained a branch office. 434 U.S., at 44-45. True, under the <i>in pari materia</i> canon of statutory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*316</span> construction, statutes addressing the same subject matter generally should be read \"`as if they were one law.'\" <i>Erlenbaugh</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 409 U.S. 239, 243 (1972) (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Freeman,</i> 3 How. 556, 564 (1845)). But venue and subject-matter jurisdiction are not concepts of the same order. Venue is largely a matter of litigational convenience; accordingly, it is waived if not timely raised. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Heckler</i> v. <i>Ringer,</i> 466 U.S. 602, 638, n. 25 (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(1). Subject-matter jurisdiction, on the other hand, concerns a court's competence to adjudicate a particular category of cases; a matter far weightier than venue, subject-matter jurisdiction must be considered by the court on its own motion, even if no party raises an objection. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Mansfield, C. &amp; L. M. R. Co.</i> v. <i>Swan,</i> 111 U.S. 379, 382 (1884); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(3).</p>\\n<p>Cognizant that venue \"is primarily a matter of choosing a convenient forum,\" <i>Leroy</i> v. <i>Great Western United Corp.,</i> 443 U.S. 173, 180 (1979), the Court in <i>Bougas</i> stressed that its \"interpretation of [the former] § 94 [would] not inconvenience the bank or unfairly burden it with distant litigation,\" 434 U.S., at 44, n. 10. Subject-matter jurisdiction, however, does not entail an assessment of convenience. It poses a \"whether,\" not a \"where\" question: Has the Legislature empowered the court to hear cases of a certain genre? See <i>Neirbo Co.</i> v. <i>Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp.,</i> 308 U.S. 165, 168 (1939) (\"This basic difference between the court's power and the litigant's convenience is historic in the federal courts.\"). Thus, the considerations that account for our decision in <i>Bougas</i> are inapplicable to § 1348, a prescription governing subject-matter jurisdiction, and the Court of Appeals erred in interpreting § 1348 <i>in pari materia</i> with the former § 94.</p>\\n<p>Significantly, this Court's reading of the venue provision in <i>Bougas</i> effectively aligned the treatment of national banks <span class=\"star-pagination\">*317</span> for venue purposes with the treatment of state banks and corporations. For venue in suits against state banks and other state-created corporations typically lies wherever those entities have business establishments. See 19 C. J. S., Corporations § 717(d), p. 374, n. 30 (1990) (under typical state venue statutes, \"[v]enue in action against domestic corporation can be laid in any county where corporation maintains branch office\"). By contrast, the Court of Appeals' decision in the instant case severely constricts national banks' access to diversity jurisdiction as compared to the access available to corporations generally. For purposes of diversity, a corporation surely is not deemed a citizen of every State in which it maintains a business establishment. See <i>Pennsylvania R. Co.</i> v. <i>St. Louis, A. &amp; T. H. R. Co.,</i> 118 U.S. 290, 295-296 (1886). Rather, under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(c)(1), a corporation is \"deemed to be a citizen\" only of \"any State by which it has been incorporated\" and \"of the State where it has its principal place of business.\" Accordingly, while corporations ordinarily rank as citizens of at most 2 States, Wachovia, under the Court of Appeals' novel citizenship rule, would be a citizen of 16 States. See FDIC Institution Directory, available at http://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/main.asp.<sup>[9]</sup><i>Bougas</i> does not call for this anomalous result.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>\\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*318</span> V</h2>\\n<p>To summarize, \"located,\" as its appearances in the banking laws reveal, see <i>supra,</i> at 313-314, is a chameleon word; its meaning depends on the context in and purpose for which it is used.</p>\\n<p>In the context of venue, \"located\" may refer to multiple places, for a venue prescription, <i>e. g.,</i> the current and former 12 U.S.C. § 94, presupposes subject-matter jurisdiction and simply delineates <i>where</i> within a given judicial system a case may be maintained. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c) (for venue purposes, \"a corporation shall be deemed to reside in any judicial district in which it is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced\").</p>\\n<p>In contrast, in § 1348, \"located\" appears in a prescription governing not venue but federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction. Concerning access to the federal court system, § 1348 deems national banks \"citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\" There is no reason to suppose Congress used those words to effect a radical departure from the norm. An individual who resides in more than one State is regarded, for purposes of federal subject-matter (diversity) jurisdiction, as a citizen of but one State. See <i>Newman-Green, Inc.</i> v. <i>Alfonzo-Larrain,</i> 490 U.S. 826, 828 (1989) (an individual is deemed a citizen of the State of her domicil); <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>Osenton,</i> 232 U.S. 619, 625 (1914) (domicil is the \"technically preeminent headquarters\" of a person; \"[i]n its nature it is one\"). Similarly, a corporation's citizenship derives, for diversity jurisdiction purposes, from its State of incorporation and principal place of business. § 1332(c)(1). It is not deemed a citizen of every State in which it conducts business or is otherwise amenable to personal jurisdiction. Reading § 1348 in this context, one would sensibly \"locate\" a national bank for the very same purpose, <i>i. e.,</i> qualification for diversity jurisdiction, in the State designated in its articles of association as its main office.</p>\\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*319</span> Treating venue and subject-matter jurisdiction prescriptions as <i>in pari materia,</i> 388 F.3d, at 422-423, the Court of Appeals majority overlooked the discrete offices of those concepts. See <i>supra,</i> at 315-316; cf. Cook, \"Substance\" and \"Procedure\" in the Conflict of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333, 337 (1933) (\"The tendency to assume that a word which appears in two or more legal rules, and so in connection with more than one purpose, has and should have precisely the same scope in all of them, runs all through legal discussions. It has all the tenacity of original sin and must constantly be guarded against.\"). The resulting Fourth Circuit decision rendered national banks singularly disfavored corporate bodies with regard to their access to federal courts. The language of § 1348 does not mandate that incongruous outcome, nor does this Court's precedent.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>* * *</h2>\\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the American Bankers Association by <i>Gregory F.

(All Internet materials as visited Jan. 13, 2006, and included in Clerk of Court's case file.) The place so designated serves as the bank's \"main office.\" Changes in the location of that office are effected by amendment to the bank's articles of association. See 12 U.S.C. §§ 21a, 30(b); 12 CFR § 5.40(d)(2)(ii) (2005). The State in which the main office is located qualifies as the bank's \"home State\" under the banking laws. 12 U.S.C. § 36(g)(3)(B).</p>\\n<p>[2]  National banks originally lacked authority to operate branch offices. Act of Feb. 25, 1863, § 11, 12 Stat. 668. In 1865, Congress enacted an exception permitting a state bank that converted to a national bank to retain its pre-existing branches. Act of Mar. 3, 1865, § 7, 13 Stat. 484. Congress authorized limited branch operations in the bank's home State in 1927 and 1933. McFadden Act (Branch Banks), 1927, § 7(c), 44 Stat. 1228; Glass-Steagall Act, 1933, § 23, 48 Stat. 189-190. These Acts, like the 1865 enactment, allowed interstate branching only under narrow \"grandfather\" provisions. McFadden Act, § 7(a)-(b), 44 Stat. 1228; see <i>Girard Bank</i> v. <i>Board of Governors of Fed. Reserve System,</i> 748 F. 2d 838, 840 (CA3 1984) (observing that only two national banks had \"grandfathered\" interstate branches). Not until 1994 did Congress grant national banks broad authority to establish branch offices across state lines. See Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, § 101, 108 Stat. 2339. See generally J. Macey, G. Miller, &amp; R. Carnell, Banking Law and Regulation 18-19, 23, 32-33 (3d ed. 2001).</p>\\n<p>[3]  Wachovia unsuccessfully moved for rehearing en banc. Six judges voted to grant the rehearing petition, three voted to deny it, and four recused themselves. Thus the petition failed to garner the required majority of the Circuit's 13 active judges. No. 03-2061 (CA4, Jan. 28, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a-58a.</p>\\n<p>[4]  The term \"established under\" did appear in the 1882 and 1887 formulations, in both texts as synonymous with the term \"organized under.\" In neither measure is the word used in a locational sense.</p>\\n<p>[5]  Earlier, in 1888, Congress had revised the 1887 prescription by adding as a separate paragraph this caveat: \"The provisions of this section shall not be held to affect the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States in cases commenced by the United States or by direction of any officer thereof, or cases for winding up the affairs of any such bank.\" Act of Aug. 13, 1888, § 4, 25 Stat. 436.</p>\\n<p>[6]  In full, the 1911 text stated:\\n</p>\\n<p>\"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction . . . [o]f all cases commenced by the United States, or by direction of any officer thereof, against any national banking association, and cases for winding up the affairs of any such bank; and of all suits brought by any banking association established in the district for which the court is held, under the provisions of title `National Banks,' Revised Statutes, to enjoin the Comptroller of the Currency, or any receiver acting under his direction, as provided by said title. And all national banking associations established under the laws of the United States shall, for the purposes of all other actions by or against them, real, personal, or mixed, and all suits in equity, be deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\" 36 Stat. 1091-1093.</p>\\n<p>The first sentence of this formulation merged the 1888 caveat with text, including the word \"established,\" originally contained in the Act of Dec. 1, 1873, § 629 (Tenth to Eleventh), 18 Stat. 111. The second sentence, including the word \"located,\" derives from the 1887 formulation.</p>\\n<p>[7]  The Court of Appeals did not overlook these nonuniform uses of the word \"located\" in various provisions of the National Bank Act. See 388 F.3d 414, 425 (CA4 2004). Nevertheless, it declared that, in § 1348, \"located\" unambiguously means \"physically present.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The court did not say what facilities other than branch offices, for example, storage sites or even automated teller machines, would suffice to establish a bank's physical presence. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-37 (counsel for respondents stated that an ATM, although an arguable question, probably would suffice to locate a bank in a State for § 1348 purposes).</p>\\n<p>[8]  Context also matters in assigning meaning to the word \"established.\" See, <i>e. g.,</i> Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, S. Treaty Doc. No. 107-19, Art. 5, pp. 8-9 (2002) (\"For the purposes of this Convention, the term `permanent establishment' means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on . . . .\"). Given the character of the proceedings covered by the first paragraph of § 1348, see <i>supra,</i> at 312, one might read \"established\" as referring to the bank's main office as set forth in its articles of association. Other readings mentioned in Court of Appeals opinions are the bank's principal place of business and the place listed in the bank's organization certificate. See <i>Horton</i> v. <i>Bank One, N. A.,</i> 387 F.3d 426, 434 (CA5 2004); <i>Firstar Bank, N. A.</i> v. <i>Faul,</i> 253 F.3d 982, 992 (CA7 2001). Because this issue is not presented by the parties or necessary to today's decision, we express no opinion on it. Cf. <i>ibid.</i></p>\\n<p>[9]  To achieve complete parity with state banks and other state-incorporated entities, a national banking association would have to be deemed a citizen of both the State of its main office and the State of its principal place of business. See <i>Horton,</i> 387 F.3d, at 431, and n. 26; <i>Firstar Bank, N. A.,</i> 253 F.3d, at 993-994. Congress has prescribed that a corporation \"shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated <i>and</i> of the State where it has its principal place of business.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1332(c)(1) (emphasis added). The counterpart provision for national banking associations, § 1348, however, does not refer to \"principal place of business\"; it simply deems such associations \"citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\" The absence of a \"principal place of business\" reference in § 1348 may be of scant practical significance for, in almost every case, as in this one, the location of a national bank's main office and of its principal place of business coincide.</p>\\n\\n</div>\n",

States.</b></p></center>\\n<center></center>\\n<p>Mr. Fillmore Beall in support of the motion.</p>\\n<p>Mr. W.F. Sapp, contra.</p>\\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\\n<p>When this cause was reached in its order upon the docket, there being no appearance by the appellant, the appellee had him called and the appeal dismissed under Rule 16. Our rules require that, \"upon the filing of the transcript of a record brought up by writ of error or appeal, the appearance of counsel for the plaintiff in error or appellant shall be entered.\" Rule 9, par. 3. This rule was adopted for the purpose of making some attorney of the court responsible for the due prosecution of the suit, and it was intended for something more than mere form. Parties should understand that they are represented here by their counsel, and that notice to counsel is ordinarily equivalent to notice to themselves.</p>\\n<p>This cause was docketed here nearly two years and a half before it was called. The attorney of record seems to have done all he was expected to do. But the appellant himself was so unmindful of his interests, that he did not know the counsel, upon whom he relied for the presentation of his case, had died before the commencement of the present term, and had been unable to attend to business on account of impaired health for a long time before his death. In the crowded state of our docket, filled with cases from all parts of the United States, it is our duty to take special care that the necessary delays in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*319</span> disposing of the business are not added to by the neglect of counsel or parties. For this reason, our rules requiring causes to be ready for hearing when reached are, and will continue to be, rigidly enforced.</p>\\n<p>Motion denied.</p>\\n</div>\n",

Mitchell</i> for plaintiff in error.</p>\\n<p><i>Mr. Assistant Attorney General Maury</i> for defendant in error.</p>\\n<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\\n<p>The plaintiff in error, Calton, was indicted in the District Court of the Second Judicial District of the Territory of Utah for the crime of murder in the first degree, in that he \"feloniously, unlawfully, wilfully, purposely, premeditatedly, deliberately, and of his malice aforethought,\" killed and murdered one Michael Cullen. Under the plea of not guilty evidence was introduced by him for the purpose of showing: first, that at the time of the killing he was incapable, by reason of unsoundness of mind, of committing any criminal offence; second, that at most the killing was \"upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion,\" and, therefore, he could not be found guilty of any higher offence than voluntary manslaughter; third, that at the time of the killing he had reasonable ground to apprehend, and did apprehend, that the deceased was about to do him great bodily harm.</p>\\n<p>He was found guilty of murder in the first degree. A motion for a new trial having been denied, and the defendant having elected, as under the territorial statutes he might do, to suffer death by shooting, rather than by hanging, it was adjudged that on a named day, between certain hours, he be publicly shot. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the Territory that judgment was affirmed, \"save as to the time and the publicity of the execution thereof.\" This saving was because the local statute provides that \"a judgment of death must be executed within the walls or yard of a jail or some convenient private place in the district.\" Laws of Utah, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> 1878, p. 136. The present writ of error brings up for review that judgment of affirmance.</p>\\n<p>It appeared in proof that Calton, Tiberty and Cullen were residents of the Star Mining District in the Territory, and well acquainted with each other. On the morning the shooting occurred, Calton and Tiberty went to Milford, a small town near by, and there happened to meet Cullen. During the day they all indulged in strong drink, and became somewhat intoxicated. They were together during most of the time, and apparently upon friendly terms. About six o'clock in the afternoon the three started for home. They left Milford together in a wagon, Calton and Cullen sitting on the driver's seat, Calton driving, and Tiberty on a pile of ore sacks in the body of the wagon. They did not get far in the direction of their homes when Tiberty, leaving his bottle of liquor on the sacks, alighted from the wagon to get a whiplash that Calton had dropped. While he was on the ground a dispute, in some way not fully explained, arose between Cullen and Calton about the possession of Tiberty's bottle of liquor. Subsequently, and while the latter was off the wagon, a struggle ensued between Cullen and Calton, during which they clinched, each one having hold of the other's throat in such manner as to satisfy Tiberty, who was a short distance away, that they were angry. At one time Cullen seemed to be pressing Calton against or over the dash-board. The latter finally released himself from the grasp of his antagonist, who was much the stouter man, and, jumping to the ground, took a loaded pistol from a bundle he had in the wagon, and fired at Cullen five shots in rapid succession. According to the statements of Tiberty the deceased did not move after the first shot, the defendant saying, immediately after that shot was fired, that he had killed him, and that he \"might as well give him the rest.\" Calton and Tiberty returned to Milford with the dead body in the wagon, and the former surrendered himself to an officer of the law.</p>\\n<p>The penal code of Utah established by the act of February 18, 1876, provides that \"every murder perpetrated by poison, lying in wait, or any other kind of wilful, deliberate, malicious <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> and premeditated killing; or committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, rape, burglary, or robbery; or perpetrated from a premeditated design, unlawfully and maliciously to effect the death of any other human being other than him who is killed; or perpetrated by any act greatly dangerous to the lives of others, and evidencing a depraved mind, regardless of human life, is murder in the first degree; and any other homicide committed under such circumstances as would have constituted murder at common law, is murder in the second degree.\" Compiled Laws Utah, 1876, p. 585.</p>\\n<p>The same code further provides that: \"Every person guilty of murder in the first degree shall suffer death, or, upon the recommendation of the jury, may be imprisoned at hard labor in the penitentiary for life, at the discretion of the court, and every person guilty of murder in the second degree, shall be imprisoned at hard labor in the penitentiary for not less than five, nor more than fifteen years.\" Compiled Laws Utah, 1876, p. 586.</p>\\n<p>It is clear that the authority given in the section last quoted, to substitute imprisonment at hard labor in the penitentiary for life for the penalty of death, when the accused is found guilty of murder in the first degree, depends upon a previous recommendation to that effect by the jury. Without such recommendation the court, in the absence of sufficient grounds for a new trial, has no alternative but to sentence the accused to suffer death. While in this case the jury were instructed as to what constituted murder in the first and second degrees, they were not informed as to their right, under the statute, to recommend imprisonment for life at hard labor in the penitentiary in place of the punishment of death. If their attention had been called to that statute, it may be that they would have made such a recommendation, and thereby enabled the court to reduce the punishment to imprisonment for life. We are of opinion that the court erred in not directing the attention of the jury to this matter. The statute evidently proceeds upon the ground that there may be cases of murder in the first degree, the punishment for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> which by imprisonment for life at hard labor will suffice to meet the ends of public justice. Its object could only have been met through a recommendation by the jury that the lesser punishment be inflicted, and it is not to be presumed that they were aware of their right to make such recommendation. The failure of the court to instruct them upon this point prevented it from imposing the punishment of imprisonment for life, even if, in its judgment, the circumstances of the case rendered such a course proper. It was well said in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Henderson, in the Supreme Court of the Territory, that by the action of the District Court \"the prisoner was deprived of a substantial right. The determination of the question as to whether he should suffer death or imprisonment was one of vital consequence to him. The jury to whom the statute commits the determination of that question, at least in part, were not informed of their duty and responsibility in the matter so as to require them to exercise their judgment and discretion in relation to it, and by the verdict they rendered the court had none.\" These views are in accordance with the fundamental rules obtaining in the trial of criminal cases involving life.</p>\\n<p>Other questions were discussed at the bar, but as the instructions relating to them are somewhat obscure, and as they may not arise upon another trial in the form in which they are now presented, we forbear a determination of them.</p>\\n<p><i>For the error indicated the judgment is reversed, with directions for a new trial, and for such further proceedings as may not be inconsistent with this opinion.</i></p>\\n</div>\n",

Freeman.</i><sup>[*]</sup></p>\\n<p>JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\\n<p>This case concerns the citizenship, for purposes of federal-court diversity jurisdiction, of national banks, <i>i. e.,</i> corporate entities chartered not by any State, but by the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Treasury. Congress empowered federal district courts to adjudicate civil actions between \"citizens of different States\" where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1). A business organized as a corporation, for diversity jurisdiction purposes, is \"deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated\" and, since 1958, also \"of the State where it has its principal place of business.\" § 1332(c)(1). State banks, usually chartered as corporate bodies by a particular State, ordinarily fit comfortably within this prescription. Federally chartered national banks do not, for they are not incorporated by \"any State.\" For diversity jurisdiction purposes, therefore, Congress has discretely provided that national banks \"shall . . . be deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\" § 1348.</p>\\n<p>The question presented turns on the meaning, in § 1348's context, of the word \"located.\" Does it signal, as the petitioning national bank and the United States, as <i>amicus curiae,</i> urge, that the bank's citizenship is determined by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*307</span> place designated in the bank's articles of association as the location of its main office?

Were we to hold, as the Court of Appeals did, that a national bank is additionally a citizen of every State in which it has established a branch, the access of a federally chartered bank to a federal forum would be drastically curtailed in comparison to the access afforded state banks and other state-incorporated entities.

Schmidt III and others, citizens of South Carolina, sued Wachovia in a South Carolina state court for fraudulently inducing them to participate in an illegitimate tax shelter. Shortly thereafter, Wachovia filed a petition in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, seeking to compel arbitration of the dispute. As the sole basis for federal-court jurisdiction, Wachovia alleged the parties' diverse citizenship. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332. The District Court denied Wachovia's petition on the merits; neither the parties nor the court questioned the existence of federal subject-matter jurisdiction. On appeal, a divided Fourth Circuit panel determined that the District Court lacked diversity jurisdiction over the action; it therefore vacated the judgment and instructed the District Court to dismiss the case.</p>\\n<p>The Court of Appeals' majority observed that Wachovia's citizenship for diversity purposes is controlled by § 1348, which provides that \"national banking associations\" are \"deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\" As the panel majority read § 1348, Wachovia is \"located\" in, and is therefore a \"citizen\" of, every State in which it maintains a branch office. Thus Wachovia's branch operations in South Carolina, in the majority's view, rendered the bank a citizen of South Carolina. Given the South <span class=\"star-pagination\">*309</span> Carolina citizenship of the opposing parties, the majority concluded that the matter could not be adjudicated in federal court. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788272\"><a href=\"/opinion/788272/wachovia-bank-national-association-v-daniel-g-schmidt-iii-priag-llc-dgs/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span>, 432 (CA4 2004).</p>\\n<p>Circuit Judge King dissented.

An enactment that year provided in relevant part:</p>\\n<blockquote>\"[T]he jurisdiction for suits hereafter brought by or against any association established under any law providing for national-banking associations . . . shall be the same as, and not other than, the jurisdiction for suits by or against banks not organized under any law of the United States which do or might do banking business where such national-banking associations may be doing business when such suits may be begun[.]\" Act of July 12, 1882, § 4, 22 Stat. 163.</blockquote>\\n<p>Under this measure, national banks could no longer invoke federal-court jurisdiction solely \"on the ground of their Federal origin,\" <i>Petri,</i> 142 U.S., at 649; instead, for federal jurisdictional purposes, Congress placed national banks \"on the same footing as the banks of the state where they were located,\" <i>Leather Manufacturers' Bank</i> v. <i>Cooper,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91892\"><a href=\"/opinion/91892/leather-manufacturers-bank-v-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span>, 780 (1887).</p>\\n<p>In 1887 revisions to prescriptions on federal jurisdiction, Congress replaced the 1882 provision on jurisdiction over national banks and first used the \"located\" language today contained in § 1348. The 1887 provision stated in relevant part:</p>\\n<blockquote>\"[A]ll national banking associations established under the laws of the United States shall, for the purposes of all actions by or against them, real, personal or mixed, and all suits in equity, <i>be deemed citizens of the States</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*311</span> <i>in which they are respectively located;</i> and in such cases the circuit and district courts shall not have jurisdiction other than such as they would have in cases between individual citizens of the same State.\" Act of Mar. 3, 1887, § 4, 24 Stat. 554-555 (emphasis added).<sup>[4]</sup></blockquote>\\n<p>Like its 1882 predecessor, the 1887 Act \"sought to limit . . . the access of national banks to, and their suability in, the federal courts to the same extent to which non-national banks [were] so limited.\" <i>Langdeau,</i> 371 U.S., at 565-566.</p>\\n<p>In the Judicial Code of 1911,<sup>[5]</sup> Congress combined two formerly discrete provisions on proceedings involving national banks, but retained without alteration the clause deeming national banks to be \"citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\" Act of Mar. 3, 1911, § 24 (Sixteenth), 36 Stat. 1091-1093.<sup>[6]</sup> Finally, as part of the 1948 Judicial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*312</span> Code revision, Congress enacted § 1348 in its current form. Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 933. The provision now reads:</p>\\n<blockquote>\"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action commenced by the United States, or by direction of any officer thereof, against any national banking association, any civil action to wind up the affairs of any such association, and any action by a banking association established in the district for which the court is held, under chapter 2 of Title 12, to enjoin the Comptroller of the Currency, or any receiver acting under his direction, as provided by such chapter.</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\"All national banking associations shall, for the purposes of all other actions by or against them, be deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1348.</blockquote>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>III</h2>\\n<p>The Fourth Circuit panel majority advanced three principal reasons for deciding that Wachovia is \"located\" in, and therefore a \"citizen\" of, every State in which it maintains a branch office. First, consulting dictionaries, the Court of Appeals observed that \"[i]n ordinary parlance\" the term \"located\" refers to \"physical presence in a place.\" 388 F.3d, at 416-417 (internal quotation marks omitted). Banks have a physical presence, the Fourth Circuit stated, wherever they operate branches. <i>Id.,</i> at 417. Next, the court noted, \"Section 1348 uses two distinct terms to refer to the presence of a banking association: `established' and `located.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 419. \"To give independent meaning\" to each word, the court said, \"it is most reasonable to understand the place where a national bank is `established' to refer to a bank's charter location, and to understand the place where it is `located' to refer to the place or places where it has a physical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*313</span> presence.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Finally, the Court of Appeals stressed that in <i>Citizens &amp; Southern Nat. Bank</i> v. <i>Bougas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109745\"><a href=\"/opinion/109745/citizens-southern-nat-bank-v-bougas/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span> (1977), this Court interpreted the term \"located\" in the former venue statute for national banks, see 12 U.S.C. § 94 (1976 ed.), as encompassing any county in which a bank maintains a branch office. 388 F.3d, at 419-420. Reasoning that \"the jurisdiction and venue statutes pertain to the same subject matter, namely the amenability of national banking associations to suit in federal court,\" the panel majority concluded that, \"under the <i>in pari materia</i> canon[,] the two statutes should be interpreted\" consistently. <i>Id.,</i> at 422.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\n<p>None of the Court of Appeals' rationales persuade us to read § 1348 to attribute to a national bank, for diversity jurisdiction purposes, the citizenship of each State in which the bank has established branch operations. First, the term \"located,\" as it appears in the National Bank Act, has no fixed, plain meaning. In some provisions, the word unquestionably refers to a single place: the site of the banking association's designated main office. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 12 U.S.C. § 52 (national bank's capital stock certificates must state \"the name and location of the association\"); § 55 (requiring notice of sale of capital stock \"in a newspaper of the city or town in which the bank is located\"); § 75 (bank's regular annual shareholders' meeting shall be rescheduled when it \"falls on a legal holiday in the State in which the bank is located\"); § 182 (requiring publication of a notice of dissolution \"in the city or town in which the association is located\"). In other provisions, \"located\" apparently refers to or includes branch offices. See, <i>e. g.,</i> § 36(j) (defining \"branch\" to include \"any branch place of business located in any State\"); § 85 (limiting interest rate charged by national bank to \"rate allowed by the laws of the State, Territory, or District where the bank is located\") (construed in OCC Interpretive Letter No. 822 (Feb. 17, 1998), [1997-1998 Transfer Binder] CCH Fed. Banking <span class=\"star-pagination\">*314</span> L. Rep. ¶ 81-265, pp. 90, 256-90, 257); 12 U.S.C. § 92 (permitting national bank to act as insurance agent in certain circumstances when bank is \"located and doing business in any place the population of which does not exceed five thousand inhabitants\") (construed in 12 CFR § 7.1001 (2005)).<sup>[7]</sup> Recognizing the controlling significance of context, we stated in <i>Bougas,</i> regarding a venue provision for national banks: \"There is no enduring rigidity about the word `located.'\" 434 U.S., at 44.</p>\\n<p>Second, Congress may well have comprehended the words \"located\" and \"established,\" as used in § 1348, not as contrasting, but as synonymous or alternative terms. When Congress enacted § 1348's statutory predecessors and then § 1348 itself, a national bank was almost always \"located\" only in the State in which it was \"established,\" under any of the proffered definitions of the two words, for, with rare exceptions, a national bank could not operate a branch outside its home State. Not until 1994 did Congress provide broad authorization for national banks to establish branches across state lines. See <i>supra,</i> at 307-308, n. 2. Congress' use of the two terms may be best explained as a coincidence of statutory codification. Deriving from separate provisions enacted in different years, the word \"established\" appearing in the first paragraph of § 1348 and the word \"located\" appearing in the second paragraph were placed in the same section in the 1911 revision of the Judicial Code. See <i>supra,</i> at 311-312, n. 6. The codifying Act explicitly stated that \"so far as [its provisions were] substantially the same as existing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*315</span> statutes,\" they should \"be construed as continuations thereof, and not as new enactments.\" Act of Mar. 3, 1911, § 294, 36 Stat. 1167; see <i>Federal Intermediate Credit Bank of Columbia</i> v. <i>Mitchell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101299\"><a href=\"/opinion/101299/federal-intermediate-credit-bank-of-columbia-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 216 (1928) (1911 Act \"was in substance a reenactment of the earlier provisions in respect of . . . jurisdiction\"). In this light, it is unsurprising that, in 1947, this Court, referring to a national bank's citizenship under the 1911 Act, used the terms \"located\" and \"established\" as alternatives. See <i>Cope</i> v. <i>Anderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104434\"><a href=\"/opinion/104434/cope-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 467 (\"For jurisdictional purposes, a national bank is a `citizen' of the state in which it is established or located[.]\").<sup>[8]</sup></p>\\n<p>Finally, <i>Bougas</i> does not control the meaning of § 1348. In that case, we construed a now-repealed venue provision, which stated that actions against national banking associations could be filed \"in any State, county, or municipal court in the county or city in which said association [was] located.\" 434 U.S., at 35-36 (quoting 12 U.S.C. § 94 (1976 ed.)). We held that, for purposes of this provision, a national bank was located, and venue was therefore proper, in any county or city where the bank maintained a branch office. 434 U.S., at 44-45. True, under the <i>in pari materia</i> canon of statutory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*316</span> construction, statutes addressing the same subject matter generally should be read \"`as if they were one law.'\" <i>Erlenbaugh</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108645\"><a href=\"/opinion/108645/erlenbaugh-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span>, 243 (1972) (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Freeman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86330\"><a href=\"/opinion/86330/united-states-v-freeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span>, 564 (1845)). But venue and subject-matter jurisdiction are not concepts of the same order. Venue is largely a matter of litigational convenience; accordingly, it is waived if not timely raised. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Heckler</i> v. <i>Ringer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111168\"><a href=\"/opinion/111168/heckler-v-ringer/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span>, 638, n. 25 (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(1). Subject-matter jurisdiction, on the other hand, concerns a court's competence to adjudicate a particular category of cases; a matter far weightier than venue, subject-matter jurisdiction must be considered by the court on its own motion, even if no party raises an objection. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Mansfield, C. &amp; L. M. R. Co.</i> v. <i>Swan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91122\"><a href=\"/opinion/91122/mansfield-c-lmr-co-v-swan/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></a></span>, 382 (1884); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(3).</p>\\n<p>Cognizant that venue \"is primarily a matter of choosing a convenient forum,\" <i>Leroy</i> v. <i>Great Western United Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110134\"><a href=\"/opinion/110134/leroy-v-great-western-united-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span>, 180 (1979), the Court in <i>Bougas</i> stressed that its \"interpretation of [the former] § 94 [would] not inconvenience the bank or unfairly burden it with distant litigation,\" 434 U.S., at 44, n. 10. Subject-matter jurisdiction, however, does not entail an assessment of convenience. It poses a \"whether,\" not a \"where\" question: Has the Legislature empowered the court to hear cases of a certain genre? See <i>Neirbo Co.</i> v. <i>Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103244\"><a href=\"/opinion/103244/neirbo-co-v-bethlehem-shipbuilding-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span>, 168 (1939) (\"This basic difference between the court's power and the litigant's convenience is historic in the federal courts.\"). Thus, the considerations that account for our decision in <i>Bougas</i> are inapplicable to § 1348, a prescription governing subject-matter jurisdiction, and the Court of Appeals erred in interpreting § 1348 <i>in pari materia</i> with the former § 94.</p>\\n<p>Significantly, this Court's reading of the venue provision in <i>Bougas</i> effectively aligned the treatment of national banks <span class=\"star-pagination\">*317</span> for venue purposes with the treatment of state banks and corporations. For venue in suits against state banks and other state-created corporations typically lies wherever those entities have business establishments. See 19 C. J. S., Corporations § 717(d), p. 374, n. 30 (1990) (under typical state venue statutes, \"[v]enue in action against domestic corporation can be laid in any county where corporation maintains branch office\"). By contrast, the Court of Appeals' decision in the instant case severely constricts national banks' access to diversity jurisdiction as compared to the access available to corporations generally. For purposes of diversity, a corporation surely is not deemed a citizen of every State in which it maintains a business establishment. See <i>Pennsylvania R. Co.</i> v. <i>St. Louis, A. &amp; T. H. R. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91700\"><a href=\"/opinion/91700/penn-co-v-st-louis-alton-c-railroad/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span>, 295-296 (1886). Rather, under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(c)(1), a corporation is \"deemed to be a citizen\" only of \"any State by which it has been incorporated\" and \"of the State where it has its principal place of business.\" Accordingly, while corporations ordinarily rank as citizens of at most 2 States, Wachovia, under the Court of Appeals' novel citizenship rule, would be a citizen of 16 States. See FDIC Institution Directory, available at http://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/main.asp.<sup>[9]</sup><i>Bougas</i> does not call for this anomalous result.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>\\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*318</span> V</h2>\\n<p>To summarize, \"located,\" as its appearances in the banking laws reveal, see <i>supra,</i> at 313-314, is a chameleon word; its meaning depends on the context in and purpose for which it is used.</p>\\n<p>In the context of venue, \"located\" may refer to multiple places, for a venue prescription, <i>e. g.,</i> the current and former 12 U.S.C. § 94, presupposes subject-matter jurisdiction and simply delineates <i>where</i> within a given judicial system a case may be maintained. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c) (for venue purposes, \"a corporation shall be deemed to reside in any judicial district in which it is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced\").</p>\\n<p>In contrast, in § 1348, \"located\" appears in a prescription governing not venue but federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction. Concerning access to the federal court system, § 1348 deems national banks \"citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\" There is no reason to suppose Congress used those words to effect a radical departure from the norm. An individual who resides in more than one State is regarded, for purposes of federal subject-matter (diversity) jurisdiction, as a citizen of but one State. See <i>Newman-Green, Inc.</i> v. <i>Alfonzo-Larrain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112278\"><a href=\"/opinion/112278/newman-green-inc-v-alfonzo-larrain/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span>, 828 (1989) (an individual is deemed a citizen of the State of her domicil); <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>Osenton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98119\"><a href=\"/opinion/98119/williamson-v-osenton/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>, 625 (1914) (domicil is the \"technically preeminent headquarters\" of a person; \"[i]n its nature it is one\"). Similarly, a corporation's citizenship derives, for diversity jurisdiction purposes, from its State of incorporation and principal place of business. § 1332(c)(1). It is not deemed a citizen of every State in which it conducts business or is otherwise amenable to personal jurisdiction. Reading § 1348 in this context, one would sensibly \"locate\" a national bank for the very same purpose, <i>i. e.,</i> qualification for diversity jurisdiction, in the State designated in its articles of association as its main office.</p>\\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*319</span> Treating venue and subject-matter jurisdiction prescriptions as <i>in pari materia,</i> 388 F.3d, at 422-423, the Court of Appeals majority overlooked the discrete offices of those concepts. See <i>supra,</i> at 315-316; cf. Cook, \"Substance\" and \"Procedure\" in the Conflict of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333, 337 (1933) (\"The tendency to assume that a word which appears in two or more legal rules, and so in connection with more than one purpose, has and should have precisely the same scope in all of them, runs all through legal discussions. It has all the tenacity of original sin and must constantly be guarded against.\"). The resulting Fourth Circuit decision rendered national banks singularly disfavored corporate bodies with regard to their access to federal courts. The language of § 1348 does not mandate that incongruous outcome, nor does this Court's precedent.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>* * *</h2>\\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the American Bankers Association by <i>Gregory F.

(All Internet materials as visited Jan. 13, 2006, and included in Clerk of Court's case file.) The place so designated serves as the bank's \"main office.\" Changes in the location of that office are effected by amendment to the bank's articles of association. See 12 U.S.C. §§ 21a, 30(b); 12 CFR § 5.40(d)(2)(ii) (2005). The State in which the main office is located qualifies as the bank's \"home State\" under the banking laws. 12 U.S.C. § 36(g)(3)(B).</p>\\n<p>[2]  National banks originally lacked authority to operate branch offices. Act of Feb. 25, 1863, § 11, 12 Stat. 668. In 1865, Congress enacted an exception permitting a state bank that converted to a national bank to retain its pre-existing branches. Act of Mar. 3, 1865, § 7, 13 Stat. 484. Congress authorized limited branch operations in the bank's home State in 1927 and 1933.

These Acts, like the 1865 enactment, allowed interstate branching only under narrow \"grandfather\" provisions.

Not until 1994 did Congress grant national banks broad authority to establish branch offices across state lines. See Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, § 101, 108 Stat. 2339. See generally J. Macey, G. Miller, &amp; R. Carnell, Banking Law and Regulation 18-19, 23, 32-33 (3d ed. 2001).</p>\\n<p>[3]  Wachovia unsuccessfully moved for rehearing en banc. Six judges voted to grant the rehearing petition, three voted to deny it, and four recused themselves. Thus the petition failed to garner the required majority of the Circuit's 13 active judges. No. 03-2061 (CA4, Jan. 28, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a-58a.</p>\\n<p>[4]  The term \"established under\" did appear in the 1882 and 1887 formulations, in both texts as synonymous with the term \"organized under.\" In neither measure is the word used in a locational sense.</p>\\n<p>[5]  Earlier, in 1888, Congress had revised the 1887 prescription by adding as a separate paragraph this caveat: \"The provisions of this section shall not be held to affect the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States in cases commenced by the United States or by direction of any officer thereof, or cases for winding up the affairs of any such bank.\" Act of Aug. 13, 1888, § 4, 25 Stat. 436.</p>\\n<p>[6]  In full, the 1911 text stated:\\n</p>\\n<p>\"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction . . . [o]f all cases commenced by the United States, or by direction of any officer thereof, against any national banking association, and cases for winding up the affairs of any such bank; and of all suits brought by any banking association established in the district for which the court is held, under the provisions of title `National Banks,' Revised Statutes, to enjoin the Comptroller of the Currency, or any receiver acting under his direction, as provided by said title. And all national banking associations established under the laws of the United States shall, for the purposes of all other actions by or against them, real, personal, or mixed, and all suits in equity, be deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\" 36 Stat. 1091-1093.</p>\\n<p>The first sentence of this formulation merged the 1888 caveat with text, including the word \"established,\" originally contained in the Act of Dec. 1, 1873, § 629 (Tenth to Eleventh), 18 Stat. 111. The second sentence, including the word \"located,\" derives from the 1887 formulation.</p>\\n<p>[7]  The Court of Appeals did not overlook these nonuniform uses of the word \"located\" in various provisions of the National Bank Act. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788272\"><a href=\"/opinion/788272/wachovia-bank-national-association-v-daniel-g-schmidt-iii-priag-llc-dgs/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span>, 425 (CA4 2004). Nevertheless, it declared that, in § 1348, \"located\" unambiguously means \"physically present.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The court did not say what facilities other than branch offices, for example, storage sites or even automated teller machines, would suffice to establish a bank's physical presence. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-37 (counsel for respondents stated that an ATM, although an arguable question, probably would suffice to locate a bank in a State for § 1348 purposes).</p>\\n<p>[8]  Context also matters in assigning meaning to the word \"established.\" See, <i>e. g.,</i> Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, S. Treaty Doc. No. 107-19, Art. 5, pp. 8-9 (2002) (\"For the purposes of this Convention, the term `permanent establishment' means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on . . . .\"). Given the character of the proceedings covered by the first paragraph of § 1348, see <i>supra,</i> at 312, one might read \"established\" as referring to the bank's main office as set forth in its articles of association. Other readings mentioned in Court of Appeals opinions are the bank's principal place of business and the place listed in the bank's organization certificate. See <i>Horton</i> v. <i>Bank One, N. A.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"36485\"><a href=\"/opinion/36485/horton-v-bank-one-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span>, 434 (CA5 2004); <i>Firstar Bank, N.

Because this issue is not presented by the parties or necessary to today's decision, we express no opinion on it. Cf. <i>ibid.</i></p>\\n<p>[9]  To achieve complete parity with state banks and other state-incorporated entities, a national banking association would have to be deemed a citizen of both the State of its main office and the State of its principal place of business. See <i>Horton,</i> 387 F.3d, at 431, and n. 26; <i>Firstar Bank, N. A.,</i> 253 F.3d, at 993-994. Congress has prescribed that a corporation \"shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated <i>and</i> of the State where it has its principal place of business.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1332(c)(1) (emphasis added). The counterpart provision for national banking associations, § 1348, however, does not refer to \"principal place of business\"; it simply deems such associations \"citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\" The absence of a \"principal place of business\" reference in § 1348 may be of scant practical significance for, in almost every case, as in this one, the location of a national bank's main office and of its principal place of business coincide.</p>\\n\\n</div>\n",

the motion.</p>\\n<p>Mr. W.F. Sapp, contra.</p>\\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\\n<p>When this cause was reached in its order upon the docket, there being no appearance by the appellant, the appellee had him called and the appeal dismissed under Rule 16. Our rules require that, \"upon the filing of the transcript of a record brought up by writ of error or appeal, the appearance of counsel for the plaintiff in error or appellant shall be entered.\" Rule 9, par. 3. This rule was adopted for the purpose of making some attorney of the court responsible for the due prosecution of the suit, and it was intended for something more than mere form. Parties should understand that they are represented here by their counsel, and that notice to counsel is ordinarily equivalent to notice to themselves.</p>\\n<p>This cause was docketed here nearly two years and a half before it was called. The attorney of record seems to have done all he was expected to do. But the appellant himself was so unmindful of his interests, that he did not know the counsel, upon whom he relied for the presentation of his case, had died before the commencement of the present term, and had been unable to attend to business on account of impaired health for a long time before his death. In the crowded state of our docket, filled with cases from all parts of the United States, it is our duty to take special care that the necessary delays in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*319</span> disposing of the business are not added to by the neglect of counsel or parties. For this reason, our rules requiring causes to be ready for hearing when reached are, and will continue to be, rigidly enforced.</p>\\n<p>Motion denied.</p>\\n</div>\n",

Argued November 28, 2005—Decided January 17, 2006\\nPetitioner Wachovia Bank, National Association (Wachovia), is a na-\\n  tional banking association with its designated main office in North\\n  Carolina and branch offices in many States, including South Caro-\\n  lina. Plaintiff-respondent Schmidt and other South Carolina citizens\\n  sued Wachovia in a South Carolina state court for fraudulently in-\\n  ducing them to participate in an illegitimate tax shelter. Shortly\\n  thereafter, Wachovia filed a petition in Federal District Court, seek-\\n  ing to compel arbitration of the dispute. As the sole basis for federal-\\n  court jurisdiction, Wachovia alleged the parties’ diverse citizenship.\\n  See 28 U. S. C. §1332. The District Court denied Wachovia’s petition\\n  on the merits. On appeal, the Fourth Circuit determined that the\\n  District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the action, va-\\n  cated the judgment, and instructed the District Court to dismiss the\\n  case. The appeals court observed that Wachovia’s citizenship for di-\\n  versity purposes is controlled by §1348, which provides that “national\\n  banking associations” are “deemed citizens of the States in which\\n  they are respectively located.” As the court read §1348, Wachovia is\\n  “located” in, and is therefore a “citizen” of, every State in which it\\n  maintains a branch office. Thus, Wachovia’s South Carolina branch\\n  operations rendered it a citizen of that State. Given the South Caro-\\n  lina citizenship of the opposing parties, the court concluded that the\\n  matter could not be adjudicated in federal court.\\nHeld: A national bank, for §1348 purposes, is a citizen of the State in\\n which its main office, as set forth in its articles of association, is lo-\\n cated. Pp. 5–15.\\n    (a) When Congress first authorized national banks, it allowed them\\n to sue and be sued in federal court in any and all civil proceedings.\\n\\f2                 WACHOVIA BANK, N. A. v. SCHMIDT\\n\\n                                  Syllabus\\n\\n    State banks, however, could initiate actions in federal court only on\\n    the basis of diversity of citizenship or the existence of a federal ques-\\n    tion. Congress ended national banks’ automatic qualification for fed-\\n    eral jurisdiction in 1882, placing them “on the same footing as the\\n    banks of the state where they were located,” Leather Manufacturers’\\n    Bank v. Cooper, 120 U. S. 778, 780. In an 1887 enactment, Congress\\n    first used the “located” language today contained in §1348. Like its\\n    1882 predecessor, the 1887 Act “sought to limit . . . the access of na-\\n    tional banks to, and their suability in, the federal courts to the same\\n    extent [as] non-national banks.” Mercantile Nat. Bank at Dallas v.\\n    Langdeau, 371 U. S. 555, 565–566. In the Judicial Code of 1911,\\n    Congress combined two formerly discrete provisions on proceedings\\n    involving national banks, but retained without alteration the “lo-\\n    cated” clause. Finally, as part of the 1948 Judicial Code revision,\\n    Congress enacted §1348 in its current form. Pp. 5–7.\\n       (b) The Fourth Circuit advanced three principal reasons for decid-\\n    ing that Wachovia is “located” in, and therefore a “citizen” of, every\\n    State in which it maintains a branch office. First, consulting diction-\\n    aries, the court observed that the term “located” refers to “physical\\n    presence in a place.” Next, the court noted that §1348 uses two dis-\\n    tinct terms to refer to the presence of a banking association: “estab-\\n    lished” and “located.” The court concluded that, to give independent\\n    meaning to each word, “established” should be read to refer to the\\n    bank’s charter location and “located,” to the place where the bank has\\n    a physical presence. Finally, the court relied on Citizens & Southern\\n    Nat. Bank v. Bougas, 434 U. S. 35, in which this Court interpreted the\\n    term “located” in the former venue statute for national banks, see 12\\n    U. S. C. §94 (1976 ed.), as encompassing any county in which a bank\\n    maintains a branch office. Viewing the jurisdiction and venue stat-\\n    utes as pertaining to the same subject matter, the court concluded\\n    that, under the in pari materia canon, the two statutes should be in-\\n    terpreted consistently. Pp. 7–8.\\n       (c) None of the Fourth Circuit’s rationales persuade this Court to\\n    read §1348 to attribute to a national bank, for diversity-jurisdiction\\n    purposes, the citizenship of each State in which the bank has estab-\\n    lished branch operations. First, the term “located,” as it appears in\\n    the National Bank Act, has no fixed, plain meaning. In some provi-\\n    sions, the word unquestionably refers to the site of the banking asso-\\n    ciation’s designated main office, but in others, “located” apparently\\n    refers to or includes branch offices. Recognizing the controlling sig-\\n    nificance of context, this Court stated in Bougas: “There is no endur-\\n    ing rigidity about the word ‘located.’ ” 434 U. S., at 44. Second, Con-\\n    gress may well have comprehended the words “located” and\\n    “established,” as used in §1348, as synonymous terms. When Con-\\n\\f                   Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                      3\\n\\n                              Syllabus\\n\\ngress enacted §1348’s statutory predecessors and §1348 itself, a na-\\ntional bank was almost always “located” only in the State in which it\\nwas “established,” under any of the proffered definitions of the two\\nwords. For with rare exceptions a national bank could not operate a\\nbranch outside its home State until 1994, when Congress broadly au-\\nthorized national banks to establish branches across state lines.\\nCongress’ use of the two terms may be best explained as a coinci-\\ndence of statutory codification. Deriving from separate provisions\\nenacted in different years, the word “established” appearing in the\\nfirst paragraph of §1348 and the word “located” appearing in the sec-\\nond paragraph were placed in the same section in the 1911 revision.\\nThe codifying Act stated that provisions substantially the same as ex-\\nisting statutes should not be treated as new enactments. Thus, it is\\nunsurprising that, in 1947, this Court, referring to a national bank’s\\ncitizenship under the 1911 Act, used the terms “established” and “lo-\\ncated” as alternatives. See Cope v. Anderson, 331 U. S. 461, 467. Fi-\\nnally, Bougas does not control §1348’s meaning. Although it is true\\nthat, under the in pari materia canon, statutes addressing the same\\nsubject matter generally should be read “ ‘as if they were one law,’ ”\\nErlenbaugh v. United States, 409 U. S. 239, 243, venue and subject-\\nmatter jurisdiction are not concepts of the same order. Venue,\\nlargely a matter of litigational convenience, is waived if not timely\\nraised. Subject-matter jurisdiction, on the other hand, concerns a\\ncourt’s competence to adjudicate a particular category of cases; a\\nmatter far weightier than venue, subject-matter jurisdiction must be\\nconsidered by the court on its own motion, even if no party raises an\\nobjection. Cognizant that venue “is primarily a matter of choosing a\\nconvenient forum,” Leroy v. Great Western United Corp., 443 U. S.\\n173, 180, the Court in Bougas stressed that its “interpretation of [the\\nformer] §94 [would] not inconvenience the bank or unfairly burden it\\nwith distant litigation,” 434 U. S., at 44, n. 10. Subject-matter juris-\\ndiction, however, does not entail an assessment of convenience. It\\nposes the question “whether” the Legislature empowered the court to\\nhear cases of a certain genre. Thus, the considerations that account\\nfor the Bougas decision are inapplicable to §1348, a prescription gov-\\nerning subject-matter jurisdiction, and the Court of Appeals erred in\\ninterpreting §1348 in pari materia with the former §94. Signifi-\\ncantly, Bougas’ reading of former §94 effectively aligned the treat-\\nment of national banks for venue purposes with the treatment of\\nstate banks and corporations. By contrast, the Fourth Circuit’s deci-\\nsion in this case severely constricts national banks’ access to diversity\\njurisdiction as compared to the access generally available to corpora-\\ntions, for corporations ordinarily rank as citizens only of States in\\nwhich they are incorporated or maintain their principal place of\\n\\f4                WACHOVIA BANK, N.

DANIEL G. SCHMIDT, III, ET AL.\\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\\n                               [January 17, 2006]\\n\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n   This case concerns the citizenship, for purposes of\\nfederal-court diversity jurisdiction, of national banks, i.e.,\\ncorporate entities chartered not by any State, but by the\\nComptroller of the Currency of the U. S. Treasury. Con-\\ngress empowered federal district courts to adjudicate civil\\nactions between “citizens of different States” where the\\namount in controversy exceeds $75,000. 28 U. S. C.\\n§1332(a)(1). A business organized as a corporation, for\\ndiversity jurisdiction purposes, is “deemed to be a citizen\\nof any State by which it has been incorporated” and, since\\n1958, also “of the State where it has its principal place of\\nbusiness.” §1332(c)(1). State banks, usually chartered as\\ncorporate bodies by a particular State, ordinarily fit com-\\nfortably within this prescription. Federally chartered\\nnational banks do not, for they are not incorporated by\\n“any State.” For diversity jurisdiction purposes, therefore,\\nCongress has discretely provided that national banks\\n“shall . . . be deemed citizens of the States in which they\\nare respectively located.” §1348.\\n   The question presented turns on the meaning, in\\n\\f2               WACHOVIA BANK, N. A. v. SCHMIDT\\n\\n                           Opinion of the Court\\n\\n§1348’s context, of the word “located.” Does it signal, as\\nthe petitioning national bank and the United States, as\\namicus curiae, urge, that the bank’s citizenship is deter-\\nmined by the place designated in the bank’s articles of\\nassociation as the location of its main office? Or does it\\nmean, in addition, as respondents urge and the Court of\\nAppeals held, that a national bank is a citizen of every\\nState in which it maintains a branch?\\n  Recognizing that “located” is not a word of “enduring\\nrigidity,” Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank v. Bougas, 434\\nU. S. 35, 44 (1977), but one that gains its precise meaning\\nfrom context, we hold that a national bank, for §1348\\npurposes, is a citizen of the State in which its main office,\\nas set forth in its articles of association, is located. Were\\nwe to hold, as the Court of Appeals did, that a national\\nbank is additionally a citizen of every State in which it has\\nestablished a branch, the access of a federally chartered\\nbank to a federal forum would be drastically curtailed in\\ncomparison to the access afforded state banks and other\\nstate-incorporated entities.

Shortly thereafter, Wachovia filed\\na petition in the United States District Court for the Dis-\\ntrict of South Carolina, seeking to compel arbitration of\\nthe dispute. As the sole basis for federal-court jurisdic-\\ntion, Wachovia alleged the parties’ diverse citizenship.\\nSee 28 U. S. C. §1332. The District Court denied Wacho-\\nvia’s petition on the merits; neither the parties nor the\\ncourt questioned the existence of federal subject-matter\\njurisdiction. On appeal, a divided Fourth Circuit panel\\ndetermined that the District Court lacked diversity juris-\\ndiction over the action; it therefore vacated the judgment\\nand instructed the District Court to dismiss the case.\\n   The Court of Appeals’ majority observed that Wacho-\\n—————— \\n\\nqualifies as the bank’s “home State” under the banking laws. 12\\n\\nU.

Thus\\nWachovia’s branch operations in South Carolina, in the\\nmajority’s view, rendered the bank a citizen of South\\nCarolina. Given the South Carolina citizenship of the\\nopposing parties, the majority concluded that the matter\\ncould not be adjudicated in federal court. 388 F. 3d 414,\\n432 (CA4 2004).\\n   Circuit Judge King dissented. He read §1348 and its\\nstatutory precursors to provide national banks with “the\\nsame access to federal courts as that accorded other banks\\nand corporations.” Id., at 434. On his reading, Wachovia\\nis a citizen only of North Carolina, the State in which its\\nmain office is located, not of every State in which it main-\\ntains a branch office; accordingly, he concluded, Wacho-\\nvia’s petition qualified for federal-court adjudication.3\\n   We granted certiorari to resolve the disagreement\\namong Courts of Appeals on the meaning of §1348. 545\\nU.

The 1887 provision stated in relevant\\npart:\\n     “[A]ll national banking associations established under\\n     the laws of the United States shall, for the purposes of\\n     all actions by or against them, real, personal or mixed,\\n     and all suits in equity, be deemed citizens of the States\\n     in which they are respectively located; and in such\\n     cases the circuit and district courts shall not have ju-\\n     risdiction other than such as they would have in cases\\n     between individual citizens of the same State.” Act of\\n     Mar. 3, 1887, §4, 24 Stat. 554–555 (emphasis added).4\\nLike its 1882 predecessor, the 1887 Act “sought to limit . . .\\nthe access of national banks to, and their suability in, the\\nfederal courts to the same extent to which non-national\\nbanks [were] so limited.” Langdeau, 371 U.

Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 933.\\nThe provision now reads:\\n        The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of\\n     any civil action commenced by the United States, or\\n     by direction of any officer thereof, against any na-\\n     tional banking association, any civil action to wind up\\n     the affairs of any such association, and any action by\\n     a banking association established in the district for\\n     which the court is held, under chapter 2 of Title 12, to\\n     enjoin the Comptroller of the Currency, or any re-\\n     ceiver acting under his direction, as provided by such\\n     chapter.\\n        “All national banking associations shall, for the\\n     purpose of all other actions by or against them, be\\n     deemed citizens of the States in which they are re-\\n     spectively located.” 28 U. S. C. §1348.\\n                          III\\n  The Fourth Circuit panel majority advanced three prin-\\n——————\\n  6 In full, the 1911 text stated:\\n   “The district courts shall have original jurisdiction . . . [o]f all cases\\ncommenced by the United States, or by direction of any officer thereof,\\nagainst any national banking association, and cases for winding up the\\naffairs of any such bank; and of all suits brought by any banking\\nassociation established in the district for which the court is held, under\\nthe provisions of title ‘National Banks,’ Revised Statutes, to enjoin the\\nComptroller of the Currency, or any receiver acting under his direction,\\nas provided by said title. And all national banking associations estab-\\nlished under the laws of the United States shall, for purposes of all\\nother actions by or against them, real, personal, or mixed, and all suits\\nin equity, be deemed citizens of the States in which they are respec-\\ntively located.” 36 Stat. 1091–1093. The first sentence of this formula-\\ntion merged the 1888 caveat with text, including the word “estab-\\nlished,” originally contained in the Act of Dec. 1, 1873, §629 (Tenth to\\nEleventh), 18 Stat. 111. The second sentence, including the word\\n“located,” derives from the 1887 formulation.\\n\\f8            WACHOVIA BANK, N. A. v. SCHMIDT\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\ncipal reasons for deciding that Wachovia is “located” in,\\nand therefore a “citizen” of, every State in which it main-\\ntains a branch office. First, consulting dictionaries, the\\nCourt of Appeals observed that “[i]n ordinary parlance”\\nthe term “located” refers to “physical presence in a place.”\\n388 F. 3d, at 416–417 (internal quotation marks omitted).\\nBanks have a physical presence, the Fourth Circuit stated,\\nwherever they operate branches. Id., at 417. Next, the\\ncourt noted, “Section 1348 uses two distinct terms to refer\\nto the presence of a banking association: ‘established’ and\\n‘located.’ ” Id., at 419. “To give independent meaning” to\\neach word, the court said, “it is most reasonable to under-\\nstand the place where a national bank is ‘established’ to\\nrefer to a bank’s charter location, and to understand the\\nplace where it is ‘located’ to refer to the place or places\\nwhere it has a physical presence.” Ibid. Finally, the\\nCourt of Appeals stressed that in Citizens & Southern Nat.\\nBank v. Bougas, 434 U. S. 35 (1977), this Court interpreted\\nthe term “located” in the former venue statute for national\\nbanks, see 12 U. S. C. §94 (1976 ed.), as encompassing any\\ncounty in which a bank maintains a branch office. 388\\nF. 3d, at 419–420. Reasoning that “the jurisdiction and\\nvenue statutes pertain to the same subject matter, namely\\nthe amenability of national banking associations to suit in\\nfederal court,” the panel majority concluded that, “under the\\nin pari materia canon[,] the two statutes should be inter-\\npreted” consistently. Id., at 422.\\n                             IV\\n  None of the Court of Appeals’ rationales persuade us to\\nread §1348 to attribute to a national bank, for diversity\\njurisdiction purposes, the citizenship of each State in\\nwhich the bank has established branch operations. First,\\nthe term “located,” as it appears in the National Bank Act,\\nhas no fixed, plain meaning. In some provisions, the word\\nunquestionably refers to a single place: the site of the\\n\\f                     Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                   9\\n\\n                         Opinion of the Court\\n\\nbanking association’s designated main office. See, e.g., 12\\nU. S. C. §52 (national bank’s capital stock certificates\\nmust state “the name and location of the association”); §55\\n(requiring notice of sale of capital stock “in a newspaper of\\nthe city or town in which the bank is located”); §75 (bank’s\\nregular annual shareholders’ meeting shall be rescheduled\\nwhen it “falls on a legal holiday in the State in which the\\nbank is located”); §182 (requiring publication of a notice of\\ndissolution “in the city or town in which the association is\\nlocated”). In other provisions, “located” apparently refers\\nto or includes branch offices. See, e.g., §36(j) (defining\\n“branch” to include “any branch place of business located\\nin any State”); §85 (limiting interest rate charged by na-\\ntional bank to “rate allowed by the laws of the State,\\nTerritory, or District where the bank is located”) (con-\\nstrued in OCC Interpretive Letter No. 822 (Feb. 17, 1998),\\n[1997–1998 Transfer Binder] CCH Fed. Banking L. Rep.\\n¶81–265, pp. 90,256-90,257); §92 (permitting national\\nbank to act as insurance agent in certain circumstances\\nwhen bank is “located and doing business in any place the\\npopulation of which does not exceed five thousand inhabi-\\ntants”) (construed in 12 CFR §7.1001 (2005)).7 Recogniz-\\ning the controlling significance of context, we stated in\\nBougas, regarding a venue provision for national banks:\\n“There is no enduring rigidity about the word ‘located.’ ”\\n434 U. S., at 44.\\n   Second, Congress may well have comprehended the\\n——————\\n   7 The Court of Appeals did not overlook these nonuniform uses of the\\n\\nword “located” in various provisions of the National Bank Act. See 388\\nF. 3d 414, 425 (CA4 2004). Nevertheless, it declared that, in §1348,\\n“located” unambiguously means “physically present.” Ibid. (internal\\nquotation marks omitted). The court did not say what facilities other\\nthan branch offices, for example, storage sites or even automated teller\\nmachines, would suffice to establish a bank’s physical presence. Cf. Tr.\\nof Oral Arg. 36–37 (counsel for respondents stated that an ATM,\\nalthough an arguable question, probably would suffice to locate a bank\\nin a State for §1348 purposes).\\n\\f10             WACHOVIA BANK, N. A. v. SCHMIDT\\n\\n                        Opinion of the Court\\n\\nwords “located” and “established,” as used in §1348, not as\\ncontrasting, but as synonymous or alternative terms.\\nWhen Congress enacted §1348’s statutory predecessors\\nand then §1348 itself, a national bank was almost always\\n“located” only in the State in which it was “established,”\\nunder any of the proffered definitions of the two words,\\nfor, with rare exceptions, a national bank could not oper-\\nate a branch outside its home State. Not until 1994 did\\nCongress provide broad authorization for national banks\\nto establish branches across state lines. See supra, at 3,\\nn. 2. Congress’ use of the two terms may be best explained\\nas a coincidence of statutory codification. Deriving from\\nseparate provisions enacted in different years, the word\\n“established” appearing in the first paragraph of §1348\\nand the word “located” appearing in the second paragraph\\nwere placed in the same section in the 1911 revision of the\\nJudicial Code. See supra, at 6–7, n. 6. The codifying Act\\nexplicitly stated that “so far as [its provisions were] sub-\\nstantially the same as existing statutes,” they should “be\\nconstrued as continuations thereof, and not as new enact-\\nments.” Act of Mar. 3, 1911, §294, 36 Stat. 1167; see\\nFederal Intermediate Credit Bank of Columbia v. Mitchell,\\n277 U. S. 213, 216 (1928) (1911 Act “was in substance a\\nreenactment of the earlier provisions in respect of . . . juris-\\ndiction”). In this light, it is unsurprising that, in 1947, this\\nCourt, referring to a national bank’s citizenship under the\\n1911 Act, used the terms “located” and “established” as\\nalternatives. See Cope v. Anderson, 331 U. S. 461, 467\\n(1947) (“For jurisdictional purposes, a national bank is a\\n‘citizen’ of the state in which it is established or located[.]”).8\\n——————\\n   8 Context also matters in assigning meaning to the word “estab-\\n\\nlished.” See, e.g., Convention Between the Government of the United\\nStates of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great\\nBritain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and\\nthe Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and\\non Capital Gains, S. Treaty Doc. No. 107–19, Art. 5, pp. 8–9 (2002)\\n\\f                      Cite as: 546 U. S. ____ (2006)                    11\\n\\n                          Opinion of the Court\\n\\n   Finally, Bougas does not control the meaning of §1348.\\nIn that case, we construed a now-repealed venue provi-\\nsion, which stated that actions against national banking\\nassociations could be filed “in any State, county, or mu-\\nnicipal court in the county or city in which said association\\n[was] located.” 434 U. S., at 35–36 (quoting 12 U. S. C.\\n§94 (1976 ed.)). We held that, for purposes of this provi-\\nsion, a national bank was located, and venue was there-\\nfore proper, in any county or city where the bank main-\\ntained a branch office. 434 U. S., at 44–45. True, under\\nthe in pari materia canon of statutory construction, stat-\\nutes addressing the same subject matter generally should\\nbe read “ ‘as if they were one law.’ ” Erlenbaugh v. United\\nStates, 409 U. S. 239, 243 (1972) (quoting United States v.\\nFreeman, 3 How. 556, 564 (1845)). But venue and subject-\\nmatter jurisdiction are not concepts of the same order.\\nVenue is largely a matter of litigational convenience; accord-\\ningly, it is waived if not timely raised. See, e.g., Heckler v.\\nRinger, 466 U. S. 602, 638, n. 25 (1984); Fed. Rule Civ.\\nProc. 12(h)(1). Subject-matter jurisdiction, on the other\\nhand, concerns a court’s competence to adjudicate a particu-\\nlar category of cases; a matter far weightier than venue,\\nsubject-matter jurisdiction must be considered by the court\\non its own motion, even if no party raises an objection. See,\\ne.g., Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379,\\n——————\\n(“For the purposes of this Convention, the term ‘permanent establish-\\nment’ means a fixed place of business through which the business of an\\nenterprise is wholly or partly carried on . . . .”). Given the character of\\nthe proceedings covered by the first paragraph of §1348, see supra, at 7,\\none might read “established” as referring to the bank’s main office as\\nset forth in its articles of association. Other readings mentioned in\\nCourt of Appeals opinions are the bank’s principal place of business and\\nthe place listed in the bank’s organization certificate. See Horton v.\\nBank One, N. A., 387 F. 3d 426, 434 (CA5 2004); Firstar Bank, N. A. v.\\nFaul, 253 F. 3d 982, 992 (CA7 2001). Because this issue is not pre-\\nsented by the parties or necessary to today’s decision, we express no\\nopinion on it. Cf. ibid.\\n\\f12           WACHOVIA BANK, N. A. v. SCHMIDT\\n\\n                      Opinion of the Court\\n\\n382 (1884); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(3).\\n   Cognizant that venue “is primarily a matter of choosing\\na convenient forum,” Leroy v. Great Western United Corp.,\\n443 U. S. 173, 180 (1979), the Court in Bougas stressed\\nthat its “interpretation of [the former] §94 [would] not\\ninconvenience the bank or unfairly burden it with distant\\nlitigation,” 434 U. S., at 44, n. 10. Subject-matter jurisdic-\\ntion, however, does not entail an assessment of conven-\\nience. It poses a “whether,” not a “where” question: Has\\nthe Legislature empowered the court to hear cases of a\\ncertain genre? See Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding\\nCorp., 308 U. S. 165, 168 (1939) (“This basic difference\\nbetween the court’s power and the litigant’s convenience is\\nhistoric in the federal courts.”). Thus, the considerations\\nthat account for our decision in Bougas are inapplicable to\\n§1348, a prescription governing subject-matter jurisdic-\\ntion, and the Court of Appeals erred in interpreting §1348\\nin pari materia with the former §94.\\n   Significantly, this Court’s reading of the venue provision\\nin Bougas effectively aligned the treatment of national\\nbanks for venue purposes with the treatment of state\\nbanks and corporations. For venue in suits against state\\nbanks and other state-created corporations typically lies\\nwherever those entities have business establishments.\\nSee 19 C. J. S., Corporations §717(d), p. 374, n. 30 (1990)\\n(under typical state venue statutes, “[v]enue in action\\nagainst domestic corporation can be laid in any county\\nwhere corporation maintains branch office”). By contrast,\\nthe Court of Appeals’ decision in the instant case severely\\nconstricts national banks’ access to diversity jurisdiction\\nas compared to the access available to corporations gener-\\nally. For purposes of diversity, a corporation surely is not\\ndeemed a citizen of every State in which it maintains a\\nbusiness establishment. See Pennsylvania R. Co. v. St.\\nLouis, A. & T. H. R.

See FDIC Institution Directory,\\navailable at http://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/ main.asp.9 Bou-\\ngas does not call for this anomalous result.\\n                             V\\n  To summarize, “located,” as its appearances in the\\nbanking laws reveal, see supra, at 8–9, is a chameleon\\nword; its meaning depends on the context in and purpose\\nfor which it is used.\\n  In the context of venue, “located” may refer to multiple\\nplaces, for a venue prescription, e.g., the current and\\nformer 12 U. S. C. §94, presupposes subject-matter juris-\\ndiction and simply delineates where within a given judicial\\nsystem a case may be maintained. See, e.g., 28 U. S. C.\\n§1391(c) (for venue purposes, “a corporation shall be\\ndeemed to reside in any judicial district in which it is\\nsubject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is\\ncommenced”).\\n——————\\n  9 To achieve complete parity with state banks and other state-\\n\\nincorporated entities, a national banking association would have to be\\ndeemed a citizen of both the State of its main office and the State of its\\nprincipal place of business. See Horton, 387 F. 3d, at 431, and n. 26;\\nFirstar Bank, N. A., 253 F. 3d, at 993–994. Congress has prescribed\\nthat a corporation “shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by\\nwhich it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its princi-\\npal place of business.” 28 U. S. C. §1332(c)(1) (emphasis added). The\\ncounterpart provision for national banking associations, §1348, how-\\never, does not refer to “principal place of business”; it simply deems\\nsuch associations “citizens of the States in which they are respectively\\nlocated.” The absence of a “principal place of business” reference in\\n§1348 may be of scant practical significance for, in almost every case, as\\nin this one, the location of a national bank’s main office and of its\\nprincipal place of business coincide.\\n\\f14           WACHOVIA BANK, N. A. v. SCHMIDT\\n\\n                      Opinion of the Court\\n\\n   In contrast, in §1348, “located” appears in a prescription\\ngoverning not venue but federal-court subject-matter\\njurisdiction. Concerning access to the federal court sys-\\ntem, §1348 deems national banks “citizens of the States in\\nwhich they are respectively located.” There is no reason to\\nsuppose Congress used those words to effect a radical\\ndeparture from the norm. An individual who resides in\\nmore than one State is regarded, for purposes of federal\\nsubject-matter (diversity) jurisdiction, as a citizen of but\\none State. See Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490\\nU. S. 826, 828 (1989) (an individual is deemed a citizen of\\nthe State of her domicil); Williamson v. Osenton, 232 U. S.\\n619, 625 (1914) (domicil is the “technically preeminent\\nheadquarters” of a person; “[i]n its nature it is one”). Simi-\\nlarly, a corporation’s citizenship derives, for diversity\\njurisdiction purposes, from its State of incorporation and\\nprincipal place of business. §1332(c)(1). It is not deemed a\\ncitizen of every State in which it conducts business or is\\notherwise amenable to personal jurisdiction. Reading\\n§1348 in this context, one would sensibly “locate” a na-\\ntional bank for the very same purpose, i.e., qualification\\nfor diversity jurisdiction, in the State designated in its\\narticles of association as its main office.\\n   Treating venue and subject-matter jurisdiction prescrip-\\ntions as in pari materia, 388 F. 3d, at 422–423, the Court\\nof Appeals majority overlooked the discrete offices of those\\nconcepts. See supra, at 11–12; cf. Cook, “Substance” and\\n“Procedure” in the Conflict of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333, 337\\n(1933) (“The tendency to assume that a word which ap-\\npears in two or more legal rules, and so in connection with\\nmore than one purpose, has and should have precisely the\\nsame scope in all of them, runs all through legal discus-\\nsions. It has all the tenacity of original sin and must\\nconstantly be guarded against.”).
